# PIR-Sensor-motion-detection_IOT
This project detects motion using a PIR sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. When motion is detected, an LED is turned on and the motion status (`true` or `false`) is sent to Firebase Realtime Database using REST API (`HTTPClient`). Built and tested and can be deployed to a real ESP32 board.
